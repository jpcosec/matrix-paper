Let's then try describing the logical structure of a partition of the world $W_i$ by the following symbolic set: 

1- A context, that is, a partition over the world $W$ that limits what belongs into $W_i$. 
2- A logical space $L_i$ that describes the admitable mapping coordinates, for example objects and their properties. 
3- A Boolean matrix $V_i$ that describes all the relationships that map the facts in relation to their truth . 
4- A Boolean matrix $S_i$ that describes all the relationships that map the facts in relation to their meaning; that is, their applicability within the logical space.

Then, we can define $W_i$ as the boolean AND operation between $V_i$ and $S_i$. Let's consider this small example;

|         | vegetable | food | leaf | root | stem |
| ------- | --------- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| lettuce | 1         |    1 |    1 |    0 |    0 |
| spinach | 1         |    1 |    1 |    0 |    0 |
| carrot  | 1         |    1 |    0 |    1 |    0 |
| celery  | 1         |    1 |    0 |    0 |    1 |

Something we can notice is that within this logical space, the properties "plant" and "food" are true for all objects containing our $W_i$, that is, they are tautological under the Tractatus definition and are therefore meaningless (sinnlos). Let's begin by removing them to facilitate further analysis. $W^{T}_i$, the transversal of this would essentially be an index of properties and which object they belong to.

|      | lettuce | spinach | carrot | celery |
| ---- | ------: | ------: | -----: | -----: |
| leaf |       1 |       1 |      0 |      0 |
| root |       0 |       0 |      1 |      0 |
| stem |       0 |       0 |      0 |      1 |

If we designate a Boolean semiring AND/OR over this space, we can verify some useful results.

* If we perform matrix multiplication of $W^T_i \otimes W_i$, we can obtain a map of property co-occurrences.
* The matrix $W$ serves as an indexing space, meaning we can take a one-hot-encoded vector of properties $v_q$ that denotes the objects we want to find. And by vector multiplication $W_i \otimes v_q$ find those vegetables that meet these properties.

Let's return to Wittgenstein for a moment; what are the logical restrictions of this system? They are those given by the categories of sense defined in the Tractatus. *Sinnlos* in this case denotes an operation that even though can be performed, does not returns any usefull result. Acording to the Tractatus, they are divided into two categories:

* Tautology, when the property returns a positive result in all cases, like the properties food and vegetable in the original example.

* Contradiction, when the search vector yields a combination of properties that returns no object, as would be the case when searching for leaf and stem in our example.

On the other hand, the category of *unsinning*, in our case, would be corresponded to operations that are not possible to be done, because of finding no coordinate in the $L_i$, the logical, such as asking for the "vegetable's" doors, or in our small universe, some property that we haven't mapped, such as sweet taste.

Until here, the proposed system does not offer anything new to the fundamental works of logic and computation. The system becomes useful once we set restrictions that allow us to turn it into a kind of logical truth machine. Indexability and unambiguity.

Let's start addressing it's extensibility. Extending $W_i$ to contain new facts is a pretty straightforward operation. If the fact has a defined coordinate (object, property) that is mappable to the current $L_i$, the mechanism is to find the coordinate and set its value to true.  Otherwise, the operation will require to add a new object or property to the coordinates and check its truthfulness $W_i$ and sense $S_i$ for every other proposition that the dimensional addition generates.

Regarding ambiguity in $W_i$, the proposed system allows us to detect it through an elementary algebraic operation.

* $W^i \otimes W^T_i$ gives us a matrix of objects against objects, containing all the facts that denote some truthfulness in the map. Note that, in this case, since we are interested only in the objects that share some property in reality, the sense layer $S_i$ can simply be ignored. Furthermore, the intersection of anything with ∅ can simply be considered 0.

* $(W^i \otimes W^T_i) - \mathbb{I}$ allows us to clear the diagonal, which contains only tautological results.

* Finally, by dimensionally collapsing this matrix by multiplying it by a vector of ones, we can detect those objects that are colliding in some property in $W_i$.

Then, to disambiguate these objects, we introduce a new property to $L_i$ that will allow us to differentiate them. In our case, since the collapse dimension is a leaf, the easiest thing to do is to add inherited properties to it, for example, rough and smooth.

|         | leaf | root | stem | (leaf) rough | (leaf) smooth |
| ------- | ---: | ---: | ---: | -----------: | ------------: |
| lettuce |    1 |    0 |    0 |            0 |             1 |
| spinach |    1 |    0 |    0 |            1 |             0 |
| carrot  |    0 |    1 |    0 |            Ø |             Ø |
| celery  |    0 |    0 |    1 |            Ø |             Ø |

Now we can notice another detail: if we make a partition defined by the objects lettuce and spinach, and the properties related to leaf, then leaf itself becomes a tautological property. However, for the carrot and celery objects, the newly introduced properties make no sense, meaning that even though the search operation can be performed on these properties, the resultant value will not reflect the degree of truth that this coordinate has for these objects. The solution can be approached in two ways:

* Use a sense mask $S_i$ around the facts that are indexable by these objects and properties, setting the result to 0 for every possible case if querying about truth.

* Create another matrix $W_i'$ that indexes only leafy vegetables. Then, the operation to search for plants by the property about their leaves becomes $W_i \otimes p'_i \otimes W'_i \otimes \otimes p'_i$. 

This gives us some interesting results:

- $W_i$ is basically a hierarchical routing space that partitions $W_i \cup W'_i$, in other words, a context index over a tensorial logic space where we can identify objects by their properties without the need to use $S_i$.
- The tensorial expansion and collapsing are reversible: $S( W_i \cup W'_i)$ can be recovered by filling the facts that the properties of $L'_i$ do not map in $L_i$ with Ø.
- The process is infinitely recursive, allowing us to perform unions, intersections and every other set operations that a boolean ring allows. And as long as we correctly permute the dimensions, we can reorganize the tensorial routes as we want.
- The introduction of hierarchies of contexts allows us to use this logic as a tree search index. Or, to treat a tree search index as a combination of truth and sense matrices.
- In the proposed example, we worked with an $L_i$ that mapped objects to properties, but $L$ contains every relation expressible with boolean logic. State machines, s-expressions, if-else flows, among others, are just instances of what can be computed with the combination of sense and logic.
- Finally, by the usage of these results, we can obtain partitions of $S$, as a set of algebraically computable logical grammar rules for determined contexts.

In Wittgenstein's words, we have defined a direct projection between thought and its logical image, represented in bits and operable through Boolean logic.
